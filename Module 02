#Description: This program demonstrates basic function syntax.

# When any Python program begins, the interpreter begins executing statements
# from the beginning of the script.

# A statement can exist outside of a function body.
print ('This statement does not belong to a function')

# Statements can also be grouped inside of functions.
def displayMessage():
    # The Python interpreted knows which statements belong to
    # the body of the function based on the indentation scheme
    # used.  Make sure that each line belonging to a given function
    # has the same number of spaces OR tabs before it.  Do not mix
    # spaces and tabs together in your spacing scheme.  For simplicity
    # it is probably best to use tabs and only tabs.
    print ('This statement is inside of a function.')

# The statements inside of a function will not execute until the function
# has been explcitely called.
print ('This message appears outside of a function after the definition')

# A function can be called by stating its name.
displayMessage()
